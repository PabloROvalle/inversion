# inversion

Three main branches in this repository.

## Main branch

The main branch now includes the code to retrieve temperature and abondances at the same time. This branch is still under development.

## Temperature branch

The temp_inv branch allows us to invert the temperature. We can activate and deactivate the upper atmosphere cutoff as a preventive method to  not to invert regions where LTE is not really happening. We can also add cloud layers if deserved.

## Abondances branch

The abond_inv branch allows us to invert the abondances of every of the 6 molecules in our atmospherical model. We can activate and deactivate the upper atmosphere cutoff as a preventive method to  not to invert regions where LTE is not really happening. We can also add cloud layers if deserved.
